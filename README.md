# Enhancing Face Image Quality Assessment through Age and Expression Analysis

Age is just a feature: Introducing the U3FQ (Unified Tri-Feature Quality) Metric. We are using Age and face expressions as features to enhance quality assessment using a tri feature metric where matching score is main feature but age difference and expression similarity will be used for making it more robust for different face image. 
>Facial Image Quality Assessment (FIQA) is crucial in enhancing face matching and recognition systems. Traditional FIQA metrics often focus on subjective human visibility, which may not correspond with the features crucial for accurate recognition. To address this issue, we propose the Unified Tri-Feature Quality Metric (U3FQ), a novel assessment framework that integrates three critical elements: age variance, facial expression impact, and congruence scores from four state-of-the-art recognition models. U3FQ utilizes an advanced learning paradigm, employing a ResNet model designed for facial image quality assessment. This approach diverges from conventional metrics by focusing on aspects directly influencing recognition accuracy, such as expression intensities and facial features' congruence with recognition models. Our method enhances congruence scores with quantitative modifiers that account for expression intensities, ensuring a more accurate quality metric for predicting recognition success likelihood. U3FQ was rigorously evaluated against general IQA techniques—BRISQUE, NIQE, and PIQE—and specialized FIQA methodologies like FaceQnet, SER-FIQ, and MagFace. The results demonstrate that U3FQ represents a significant advancement in FIQA, offering a holistic and theoretically robust assessment tool that is highly relevant for various facial recognition scenarios.
